### AI and Robotics Week 10
This week's Python content will look at some very pragmatic and practical approaches towards implementing AI systems for commons tasks that we might find in the world!

## Colab Notebooks
As in other weeks, we have colab notebooks to guide you through implementing these systems:

# Autonomous vehicles and understanding threats on the road

# Face detection and an introduction to OpenCV
